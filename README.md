Predictive coding-inspired neural network models

The spirit of this project is to experiment with neural network implementations of predictive coding (Rao & Ballard, 1999). Predictive coding is an influential theory in cognitive neuroscience, but at the moment remains relatively unexplored at the level of systems neuroscience. 

In its essence, predictive coding is just control theory:
